### DriverPass - Summary

Liam, the owner of DriverPass, has come to a consulting company in regards to creating a system which functions to help driver students learn more about driving. The purpose fo DriverPass is to offer students an online course and test that reflect the current policies of the DMV, as well as offer in-person driving experience to help students transition their way into driving better. The system asked to be designed had to be online for students to access and consisted of students, a secretary, an IT officer, and Liam to interact with the system with different roles and privileges.

### DriverPass - Personal Achievement

The one aspect I think I really did well with these projects were describing all of the technical functional requirements of the system. As opposed to the nonfunctional requirement that could have a range of quality of life parts to it, the functional requirements come straight from what Liam wanted his system to be composed of. Creating a list of what the system should be able to do for all the people involved is one point I think I did well with this assignment.

### DriverPass - Revisit Piece

One part of the projects that were built that I would like to improve upon are most likely the system activity diagrams. I like making diagrams that are meaningful and detailed, but the ones I created felt lack-luster and conveyed only the overall point of what the use case was meant to do. While I do believe simplicity is a great thing for all people to understand, both the tehcnical and non-technical, I also think it might leave room for more question as to how much the system interact if data flowed elsewhere. Additionally, I would have liked to ask more questions from the client, Liam, because a lot of information was left out such as whether the system is app-based or an online website.

### DriverPass - Interpreting User Needs

By analzing the functional and nonfunctional requirements, I found it easier to organize what the user needs were. Most of what the system should be able to do were to be listed as functional requirements, while the quality of the system included with measurable aspects would be put into nonfunctional requirements. It's important considering the user's needs when designing because handing over a system the user did not want is contrary to working for them. In a sense, it fails to meet the contract both parties formed as one party did not receive an accurate product described by themselves.

### System Analysis and Design

Designing in software can be tricky for me as I do not have one single method to approach all kinds of projects. Depending on the complexity and scale, I may sometimes write the program from scratch without much of a hassle while other times I would like to utilize a UML diagram to help keep track of what class objects interact with one another and how the system is meant to be built. One skill I learned in this class that I would absolutely like to bring with me in the future is the creation of UML class diagrams and activity diagrams. I believe both of these are great to show the team how I think a system should be designed and implemented. It is a form of communication that most people would understand while avoiding technical jargon.
